# Dev Log - 2026-01-22

## Session Focus
Wrapped up v0.2 and began v0.3 iteration cycle with specification and documentation work.

## Summary

**v0.2 Wrap-up:**
- Reverse-engineered current codebase into `docs/0.2_final-spec.md`
- Documented architecture, data model, features, API, and lessons learned

**v0.3 Pre-spec:**
- Drafted `docs/0.3_pre-spec.md` with new conceptual direction
- Key reframe: "file manager" → "information manager for objects with URI sources"
- Refined data model through iterative Q&A
- Scope: implement `file://` and `https://` sources

**Documentation created:**
- `docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md` — north star, principles, success criteria
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` — canonical terminology definitions
- `docs/adr/` — 6 Architecture Decision Records

## Key Decisions Made
- Objects use URI-based `source` field (not `source_path`)
- Tags split into TagDefinitions + TagAssignments
- Collections support AND/OR/NOT query logic
- Database is single source of truth (no localStorage)
- Links are configurable as directional or bidirectional

## Next Steps
- Finalize 0.3 pre-spec → spec
- Begin v0.3 implementation (Phase 1: Core Architecture)
