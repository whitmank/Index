I’ve always been interested in making software — but I’ve never been particularly good at programming.

The executive calculus is shifting.
Before I had ideas, fleshed them out, designed them, but when faced with implementation, faltered,
I now have access to artificial intelligence. Remote, subscription based intelligence, provided by Anthropic though the Claude Code utility.
It works. It’s controversial to say, and I know it’s not perfect, but it works, it’s doing the work of a software development.*at least for my level of use, which is making greenfield applications, situated software, not scalable, for particular users.

The bottleneck on my creativity is no longer the intelligence required to write the code. That has been codified, or more accurately, modeled.
Now, I can apply human intelligence of my own, that the machine (as of yet) does not possess.
I can use my intelligence to make decisions not about how to build a specific feature, or make some certain logic behave as I want it to, but to articulate and architect the software that I believe should be made to serve people.

One must choose first what to execute, then how to execute it.

I was getting bogged down in the code execution phase, because I haven’t been super effective in learning how to do so. But truth is, I don’t really want to. I want to specialize in design, human-wise, interaction layer decision making.

Now I can, and I can turn that work into something useful.
Plans without execution means nothing, but execution is finally within my grasp. My command of programming language is amateur at best. For English however, I believe my command is quite strong. The computer can now interpret English.
