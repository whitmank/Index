# Development Log - File Indexer Module

**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours
**Objective:** Refactor scanner module into fs-indexer service with file selection UI and keyboard interactions

## Changes Made

### Core Service Architecture
- Refactored `scanner` module into modular `fs-indexer` service structure
- Maintained existing file scanning, metadata extraction, and hashing capabilities
- Improved separation of concerns across scanner.js, metadata-extractor.js, and hash-service.js

### File Selection UI
- Built `AddFilesModal` component for multi-file selection interface
- Integrated with directory listing display in results panel

### User Interaction Features
- **Multi-select support:** Cmd+Click / Ctrl+Click for individual file selection, Shift+Click for range selection
- **Keyboard shortcuts:**
  - Delete key: Remove selected files
  - Cmd+A / Ctrl+A: Select all files in listing
- **Paste-to-import UX:** Paste file path directly to auto-open import modal
- **System file filtering:** Automatically excluded .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, and other system files

### Code Cleanup
- Eliminated duplicate display logic in results rendering
- Streamlined component state management

## Technical Decisions
- Maintained backwards-compatible API for scanner functionality
- Implemented filter logic at UI layer for system file exclusion
- Used native keyboard event handling for shortcuts to avoid library dependencies

## Testing & Verification
- Multi-select interactions verified with keyboard and mouse combinations
- System file filtering validated against common OS artifacts
- Modal open/close flows tested with paste event integration

## Next Steps
- Implement file preview functionality for selected items
- Add bulk operations (move, copy, delete) for multi-select
- Integrate with backend indexing pipeline
- Performance optimization for large file listings

## Notes
- Component structure supports future accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, focus management)
- Filter list can be extended via config for additional system files
